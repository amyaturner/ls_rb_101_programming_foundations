# On docs.ruby-lang.org, YAML search turns up this page:
# https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/YAML.html
# which says YAML module is an alias of Psych.
# When you click the link for Psych from that YAML Module page, you find the ::load_file method there.

# Found 'Psych.load_file' at docs.ruby-lang.org

# https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Psych.html#method-c-load_file



# Also found YAML::load_file at ruby-doc.org:

# https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.8.6/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html#method-c-load_file

# But guess that's old, so it seems the Psych link above is more up-to-date.
