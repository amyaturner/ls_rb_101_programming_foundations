# Write a method that takes one integer argument, which may be positive, negative, or zero.
# This method returns true if the number's absolute value is odd.
# You may assume that the argument is a valid integer value.

# Further Exploration:

# If you weren't certain whether % were the modulus or remainder operator,
# how would you rewrite #is_odd? so it worked regardless?


def odd_num(int)
