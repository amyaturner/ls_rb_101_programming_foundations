# COMMENTS: strangely my original code (without extracting the loops, etc. into helper methods was 58 lines of code, whereas refactored it's 102 lines.
# And for me, with this simple program, the refactored version is actually harder for me to read than the original â€“ but perhaps just in this case.
# I'm very glad I did the refactoring though. It was VERY difficult for me and the first big frustration and major confusion I've had in the program so far.
# But I took a couple breaks and then came back and that was a big help in seeing new info my brain wouldn't take in before the break.
# I think refactoring and playing with the code this way, even if tedious, is what programming becomes all about and this is precisely where the deeper learning comes from.
# So today was frustrating and also a big success in terms of deeper understanding about how Ruby works and conventions about how to structure a smaller program. I can see the benefits
# of extracting longer code sections to helper methods. I'm not sure I did all that in the most efficient way, but just doing it is where the comprehension came from.
